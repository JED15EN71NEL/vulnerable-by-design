My name is Courage and this is my blog.

## A few things about me upfront

1. I am a recovering addict whose life became unmanageable.
2. I came to believe that a Power greater than myself could restore me to sanity.
3. I made a decision to turn my will and my life over to the care of God as I understand Him.

## Vulnerable

In the 12 Steps of Recovery used by Alcoholics Anonymous and other recovery programs, I was puzzled at first by steps 6 and 7

6. _Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character._
7. _Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings._

I have met many individuals in recovery with amazing lengths of sobriety, but I haven't met a single human being without defects of character and shortcomings.

## By Design

The religion of my childhood taught me that a Creator God created humans in order to love them and for them to know this love. As an adult in recovery, this love story has become more than words in an old book. As a husband, I understand that love grows as vulnerability increases. And as a father, I love when my kids rely on me but I also want them to grow and mature.

## Vulnerable by Design

In my career as a computer security engineer (aka **hacker**), there is a constant need to expand ones knowledge. One popular method for doing this is the use of special machines designed to be vulnerable so that you can break into them and truly understand whatever the box was designed to teach. I have learned on many of these over the years but now the term has so much more meaning to me. I am vulnerable by design. And this blog is my way of letting you break into my life so that you can learn whatever I was designed to teach.

## Stay tuned
This blog has only just begun. Expect to see varied content including technical HowTos, personal stories of my recovery journey, thoughts about the God of my understanding and even the occasional poem or song when the inspiration comes.
